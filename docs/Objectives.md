# Objectives

The main research objective of this project is:

>*To develop an open-source, machine learning-based electricity market model for the North Sea region which will help electricity generators, retailers, large consumers, BRPs and system operators in short-term electricity markets (i.e., day-ahead and intra-day markets) to develop operational and bidding strategies that maximise their profits under uncertainty of VRE generation. The model will consist of a forecaster based on machine learning, which will use high resolution time series weather forecasts for the upcoming period, and recent historical measurements of electricity generation, demand and market prices, to forecast the latter three quantities for the upcoming period. These forecasts will serve as inputs to an optimiser, which maximises social welfare in the electricity market.*

Based on the main research objective, the following research questions have been derived:

* What methods and resources are needed to process and store the large volume of high resolution data required for this model?
* What type of machine learning algorithms are suited for the time series forecasting of electricity prices, demand and generation?
* What optimisation methods are suitable for maximising the social welfare problem in the electricity market, and what are the constraints to this optimisation problem?
* What methods can be used to analyse the inputs and outputs of the model and translate them into operational strategies relevant to the market participant?
* How can this model be standardised and published so that it is available for use openly by any participant in the electricity market, as well as other interested parties, such as policymakers?
* How can this high resolution electricity market operational model be integrated with the overall North Sea energy systems model to provide insights on long-term planning and investments in the energy sector?

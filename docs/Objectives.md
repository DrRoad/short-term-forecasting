# Objectives

The main research objective of this project is:

>*To develop an open-source electricity market model for the North Sea region which will help electricity generating companies that participate in short-term electricity markets (i.e., day-ahead and intra-day markets) to develop operational and bidding strategies that maximise their revenue under uncertainty of VRE generation. The model will consist of a forecaster based on machine learning, which will use high resolution time series weather forecasts for the upcoming period, and recent historical measurements of electricity generation, demand and market prices, to forecast the latter three quantities for the upcoming period. These forecasts will serve as inputs to a decision-making tool, which decides whether to sell, store and/or convert the electricity based on the most economical approach for the company's production portfolio.*

Based on the main research objective, the following research questions have been derived:

* What methods and resources are needed to process and store the large volume of high resolution data required for this model?
* What type of machine learning algorithms are suited for the time series forecasting of electricity prices, demand and generation?
* What methods can be used to analyse the inputs and outputs of the model and translate them into operational strategies relevant to the market participant?
* How can this model be standardised and published so that it is available for use openly by any participant in the electricity market, as well as other interested parties, such as policymakers?
* How can this high resolution electricity market operational model be integrated with the overall North Sea energy systems model to provide insights on long-term planning and investments in the energy sector?

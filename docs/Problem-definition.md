# Problem definition

The table below shows the characteristics of the main energy generation technologies, including their costs. These generation sources have different variabilities, fuel types, flexibilities, costs and carbon emissions. According to the EU reference scenario 2016 [EnerND], wind and solar energy resources, which are VRE resources, are expected to generate a total of 35 % of EU's electricity by 2050, which is a significant increase (23 %) from 2015 levels. Conversely, generation from nuclear and solids, which are not variable and provide base load generation, are expected to decrease significantly. Unlike conventional generators, VRE are intermittent as they are dependent on atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed and cloud cover, and they vary spatially (i.e., location-dependent) and temporally [Josk11]. Therefore, VRE generation cannot be controlled to meet the demand patterns and needs of the energy system [Josk11], which is a challenge to electricity and energy system operators in general.

# Bidding zones

## Definition

* The largest geographical area within which market participants are able to exchange energy without capacity allocation. 
* The majority of bidding zones in Europe are defined by national borders (e.g., France or the Netherlands).
* Some are larger than national borders (e.g., Austria, Germany and Luxembourg or the Single Electricity Market for the island of Ireland) 
* Some are smaller zones within individual countries (e.g., Italy, Norway or Sweden).

\section{Background}\label{background}}

The transition towards a future low-carbon economy is driven globally by
the Paris Agreement {[}Pari15{]}, which recognises the need for
sustainable development worldwide to counter the threats of climate
change. The European Union (EU) is committed to reduce greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions by 2050 to 80-90 \% below 1990 levels {[}Ener12{]}. As
the energy industry is responsible for the highest share of
anthropogenic GHG emissions, importance is placed on how changes in
energy systems can help achieve these GHG emission reduction targets
{[}Ener12{]}.

A number of opportunities exist for the decarbonisation of the energy
industry. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), in their
renewable energy roadmap study, has identified renewable energy as
having the highest potential in reducing energy-related carbon dioxide
(CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions globally, which is closely followed by
energy efficiency and electrification with renewable energy
{[}Glob18{]}. In a 2018 political agreement, the EU member states agreed
upon a target of at least 32 \% of the demand being met with renewables
by 2030, through national targets of the individual member states
{[}ReneND{]}. The electricity demand in the transport sector is also
expected to increase due to expected petrol and diesel engine bans and
subsequently the electrification of road transport {[}Worl17{]}.

The energy system is also transitioning towards a decentralised system
with more consumer participation and new forms of flexibilities,
including sector coupling, demand-side management (DSM), energy
conversion and storage, cross-border interconnection and curtailment.
This allows demand patterns to shift to better suit the generation
patterns in systems with high penetration of variable renewable energy
(VRE) resources, such as solar and wind {[}Lund17{]}, {[}Towa18{]}.
However, this requires cooperation involving many actors with various
responsibilities and dependencies that interact within this energy
system, and opens up the opportunity to perform interdisciplinary
research work in the area of energy system analysis.

The ENSYSTRA - ENergy SYStems in TRAnsition Innovative Training Network
has been established to address the challenges of the energy transition
with interdisciplinary collaboration and regional cooperation involving
academia, government and industry {[}AbouND{]}. ENSYSTRA is centred on
the North Sea region and focusses on performing interdisciplinary
modelling work involving technology, economics, social science and
humanities, and combining various modelling approaches in different
levels and resolutions. ENSYSTRA aims to keep an open science approach,
which will allow the resulting models to be subject to full scientific
scrutiny.

Energy systems models, which are tools used to project the future energy
supply of a country or region {[}Herb12{]}, is the centre of ENSYSTRA.
The figure below explains the energy systems modelling process using a
system analysis approach {[}Kroo15{]}. This process starts with creating
a model of the actual energy system by simplifying and conceptualising
the present system. This conceptualised system with all assumptions is
then mathematically solved to produce numerical results. These results
can then be interpreted and conclusions can be drawn regarding the
future energy system. Such conclusions form the evidence-base for
decision makers, resulting in policy implications or operational
strategies that help achieve these climate targets.

\end{figure}

There are 15 early-stage researchers (ESRs) across four work packages
(WPs) in ENSYSTRA, as shown in the figure below. The research project
entitled ``Development of a real-time optimisation solution for
dispatchable energy supply units'' is conducted by ESR 9, who is
enrolled as a PhD student at University of Stavanger (UiS) in Norway.
This project is within WP 2 (technology prospects and development
pathways), which focusses on technological options for the energy
transition, mainly in terms of techno-economic performance over time.
For this research project, the technology focus is on the digitalisation
of the electricity sector. As the electricity system transitions into
smart systems, the system will have an increasing amount of sensors and
controllers that continuously record measurements of the system
{[}Lund17{]}. Advancements in these technologies mean that data that is
fast, heterogeneous and high in volume from the electricity system will
be generated. Data with these characteristics must be managed and
analysed effectively to gain insights on the electricity system, which
can then be converted to strategies that optimise the system
{[}Mana12{]}. This project will specifically investigate how artificial
intelligence (AI) can play a role in the transition to a low-carbon
electricity system by utilising high resolution data of the system. The
next section will investigate this, as well as explain what is meant by
``real-time'' and ``dispatchable'' in the context of electricity systems
in this project.

\section{Problem definition}\label{problem-definition}}

\hypertarget{electricity-system}{%
\subsection{Electricity system}\label{electricity-system}}

The electricity system can be seen as having two components; the
physical grid consisting of generators and transmission and distribution
systems, and the electricity market consisting of a number of actors
{[}Erba16{]}.

Electricity systems exist in different resolutions and levels of
uncertainty. The figure below represents the different scales of
electricity systems, mainly in terms of temporal resolution, but also
uncertainty and spatial resolution {[}Glis18{]}, {[}Pfen14{]}.
Temporally, ``real-time'' is referred to as the time of dispatch. It can
be observed that the operational planning scale has high spatial and
temporal resolution, and relatively low uncertainty. Operational
planning includes dispatch planning and plant scheduling (i.e., unit
commitment), which ranges from a few minutes to a week before dispatch.
Maintenance planning can take a few weeks to years, as it involves
upgrade and maintenance work which may require shut-down of units or
assets, in turn affecting the availability of generation units and grid
infrastructure. Adequacy assessments, which takes years, involve
assessing the existing generation and storage capacities and planning
for new installations based on demand projections, to ensure this demand
will be met in the future. Finally, grid investment decisions, including
planning transmission and distribution grid networks, cross-border and
regional interconnections and grid capacity expansions, take many years
to decades and have very high uncertainty as a result.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{generation-technologies}{%
\subsection{Generation technologies}\label{generation-technologies}}

The table below shows the characteristics of the main energy generation
technologies, including their costs. These generation sources have
different variabilities, fuel types, flexibilities, costs and carbon
emissions. According to the EU reference scenario 2016 {[}EnerND{]},
wind and solar energy resources, which are VRE resources, are expected
to generate a total of 35 \% of EU's electricity by 2050, which is a
significant increase (23 \%) from 2015 levels. Conversely, generation
from nuclear and solids, which are not variable and provide base load
generation, are expected to decrease significantly. Unlike conventional
generators, VRE are intermittent as they are dependent on atmospheric
conditions, such as wind speed and cloud cover, and they vary both
spatially (i.e., location-dependent) and temporally {[}Josk11{]}.
Therefore, VRE generation cannot be controlled to meet the demand
patterns and needs of the energy system {[}Josk11{]}, which is a
challenge to electricity and energy system operators in general. The
costs listed in this table are derived based on National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL)'s NREL-SEAC 2008 Data Set {[}Tidb10{]}. VRE
generation technologies have high capital expenditure (CAPEX) compared
to conventional fossil-powered and biomass generation. Conversely, the
operational expenditure (OPEX), which includes fuel and fixed
operational and maintenance (O\&M) costs, is low for VRE generation
technologies, as they have no fuel costs unlike conventional generators.

\hypertarget{electricity-market}{%
\subsection{Electricity market}\label{electricity-market}}

The actors in the electricity market include {[}Erba16{]}, {[}PinsND{]},
{[}TheC15{]}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Generator
\item
  Retailer
\item
  Large and small consumer
\item
  Transmission system operator (TSO)
\item
  Distribution network operator (DNO)
\item
  Balance responsible party (BRP)
\item
  Aggregator
\item
  Regulator
\item
  Market operator
\end{itemize}

There are two types of electricity markets; the retail market and the
wholesale market {[}Erba16{]}. The retail market involves the retailers
buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers. The
wholesale market involves generators, retailers and (large) consumers,
who buy and sell electricity. Energy-only transactions in the wholesale
market have different temporal resolutions {[}PinsND{]}, {[}TheC15{]}
and take place before dispatch, shown in green in the figure below.
Balancing markets, shown in pink in the figure below, which involve both
energy and services, operate both before and after dispatch
{[}TheC15{]}. The energy-only markets are operated by the market
operator or power exchanges, while the balancing market is operated by
the system operator. The day-ahead and intra-day markets can be
considered short-term electricity markets, as the former takes place 24
hours in advance of dispatch, while the latter takes place continuously
after the day-ahead market, up to minutes before dispatch {[}Over16{]}.

\section{Objectives}\label{objectives}}

The main research objective of this project is:

\begin{quote}
\emph{To develop an open-source, machine learning-based electricity
market model for the North Sea region which will help electricity
generators, retailers, large consumers, BRPs and system operators in
short-term electricity markets (i.e., day-ahead and intra-day markets)
to develop operational and bidding strategies that maximise their
revenue under uncertainty of VRE generation. The model will consist of a
forecaster based on machine learning, which will use high resolution
time series weather forecasts for the upcoming period, and recent
historical measurements of electricity generation, demand and market
prices, to forecast the latter three quantities for the upcoming period.
These forecasts will serve as inputs to an optimiser, which maximises
social welfare in the electricity market and produces a list of offers,
which will be translated into operational strategies.}
\end{quote}

Based on the main research objective, the following research questions
have been derived:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What methods and resources are needed to process and store the large
  volume of high resolution data required for this model?
\item
  What type of machine learning algorithms are suited for the time
  series forecasting of electricity prices, demand and generation?
\item
  What optimisation methods are suitable for maximising the social
  welfare problem in the electricity market, and what are the
  constraints to this optimisation problem?
\item
  What methods can be used to analyse the inputs and outputs of the
  model and translate them into operational strategies relevant to the
  market participant?
\item
  How can this model be standardised and published so that it is
  available for use openly by any participant in the electricity market,
  as well as other interested parties, such as policymakers?
\item
  How can this high resolution electricity market operational model be
  integrated with the overall North Sea energy systems model to provide
  insights on long-term planning and investments in the energy sector?
